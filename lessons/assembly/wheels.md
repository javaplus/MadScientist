# Wheels and Tracks

### Wheels and Tranny


### Parts

- 4 wheels
- 2 transmission pieces

Now let's install the wheels.  

Take your 4 wheels and snap them on the chassis.  Make sure the flat side is against the chassis.  Once they snap on, give them a spin with your hand to make sure they can spin freely without much resistance.

Now install the 2 transmission pieces.  The axles have a D shape.  The tranny parts have a D shaped slot in the center.  Match the holes to put the tranny onto the axle.  
The easiest way to do this is to start inserting the tranny piece into the wheel until it hits the axle while holding the motor from sliding back.  Then rotate the wheel and the tranny till the D shaped hole and the axle line up and you can push the tranny in flush with the outside of the wheel.

### Tracks

### Parts
- Track pieces (2 tracks)
- 2 small pieces of 3D printer filament

Take one track at a time and wrap it around the wheels BEFORE connecting with the filament. It's recommended to have the end of one track rest on top of one wheel with the other end just below it as you see in the picture below:

Now align the two ends of the track and insert a piece of filament through the hole to connect them as seen in the picture below:

If you struggle getting enough slack in the tracks to get the ends to line up to insert the filament, try rotating the wheels a little back and forth until the tracks lay with their notched hole over the diamond tabs on the surface of the wheels. With a little sliding of the tracks and rotating of the wheels, you should be able to easily line up the ends of the tracks to connect them.  

Once the ends are aligned, push the filament through till its flush with the inner most piece of the track closest to the chassis.  Once connected you can cut the filament off to be as flush as possible, but if it sticks out a little it should be fine as long as it's not protruding too much on the inside where it might rub on the chassis as the treads move around the wheels.

Repeat these instructions to assemble the second track.


Jump around and celebrate!
