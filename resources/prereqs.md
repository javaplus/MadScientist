# Prerequisites For Mad Scientist Shark Rover Lab

## Overview
For this lab, you will be assembling and coding a Raspberry Pi Pico powered Shark Rover.  The hardware and parts will all be provided.  You will need to have a laptop that can access the internet to get the directions and the code.  The code is in micro Python.  For these labs, you do NOT have to be a Python expert. You can actually get by fine without having ever done Python programming before. We will provide all the code required to get your Rover working.  You do have the option to extend or add to the code to create your own game modes.  So, if you want to get a little familar with Python before coming you can check out this free tutorial get comfortable with Python. [Python Tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/)

## What you need

### Thonny
You just need the simple Python editor [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) which allows you write code on your laptop and execute it on the Pico via a USB cable. USB cables will be provided just make sure you have a laptop with Thonny installed and an available USB A jack on your laptop. We will have a few USB C to USB A adapters for those with only tiny ports. If you require a special dongle to connect a USB A cable into your laptop, be sure to bring it.

Please download and install the latest version(4.x or higher) of Thonny.

### Mobile app

To control your completed shark rover, you most likely want to use our mobile app.  The directions to install it can be found here: [Mad Scientist Controls](https://github.com/javaplus/mad_scientist_app)

## But I want to use VS Code (Alternative to Thonny)

Thonny is very basic and is not a robust IDE. If you'd prefer to use VS Code, you can, but you will need to add an extension to allow VS Code to deploy the code on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
If you decide to try to do this lab in VS Code, I'd recommend still having Thonny installed as a back up incase the VS Code extension cannot properly connect to the Pico.

Here is the VS Code extension: [MicroPico VS Code Extension](https://github.com/paulober/MicroPico?tab=readme-ov-file)
